## What is ColorSeq?

ColorSeq is the library that manages the VT color sequences and gets information about them. It's used to print the VT sequences to change the color, check whether the color is bright or dark, get RGB values from 255 colors, and much more.

## What is this web page?
 
This webpage is not a wiki for the general use of ColorSeq; it's an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of ColorSeq.

If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of KS, you may refer to the [releases](https://github.com/Aptivi/ColorSeq/releases) page of the project and download the attached `0.0.x.y-doc.rar` file.

To get started using the documentation, select `KS API` from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API that ColorSeq provides.
